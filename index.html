        <h2>Why Mexico City?</h2>
        <p>
            Mexico City, a vibrant metropolis that now stands as the capital of Mexico, has a rich and multifaceted history that traces its origins to ancient times. The city's foundation can be attributed to the Aztecs, who established their magnificent capital of Tenochtitlan on an island in the middle of Lake Texcoco in the 14th century. Characterized by intricate networks of canals, floating gardens, and awe-inspiring pyramids, Tenochtitlan thrived as a cultural and political hub until its conquest by Spanish forces led by Hernán Cortés in 1521.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Spanish colonial era saw the city's transformation into a European-style urban center, with grand cathedrals, palaces, and plazas taking root amidst the remnants of Aztec marvels. Over the centuries, Mexico City evolved through various phases, grappling with challenges such as urbanization, social upheaval, and cultural fusion. Today, it stands as a bustling amalgamation of history and modernity, where ancient civilizations' legacy intertwines with contemporary dynamism.
